	Currently, there is no disavowing that green campus has become more than predominating in the school.
When it comes to green campus, it is universally acknowledged that everyone attribute great importance to environment for certain.
	 From my perspective, firstly,environment exert a positive effluence on students and teacher on campus, 
 but as it is, creating a good campus not only all individuals make joint efforts to protect the environment,but also   requires forming a good human circumstances.Additionally, everyone looks forward to living in a green environment,
 which has benn pursued all the time,whereas quite a few students drop litter everywhere arbitrarily. Provided that
 we may as well care for the environment, the school will be more beautiful. Meanwhile, on no account we ignore
 the impotance of human circumstances. Subsequently, when everyone's heart is virginal and kind, we can live up to
 ourselves.
