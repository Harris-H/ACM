	Nowadays, there is no denying that plastic surgery has become very popular and common.When it comes
 to korea,it is universally acknowledged that plastic surgery is a symbol of korea for certain.
                  From my perspective,  although plastic surgery is of innocence, this behavior needs to be appropriately  controlled. Firstly, everyone looks forward to becoming handsome and beautiful, which has been pursured all the time.
 Additionally, good appearance not only gives a very good impression, but also has advantages in many aspects,  whereas appearance are directly determined at birth.If you only rely on plastic surgery to change your appearance, the  results are often counterproductive.Therefore, we may as well appropriately take advantage of plastic  surgery. Meanwhile, on no account can we ignore the harm of plastic surgery. when everyone attribute great importance to finding a balance between health and beauty, we will live up to ourselves. Subsequently, plastic surgery
 has a postive effect on those who pursue beauty properly.In a nutshell, plastic surgery is not the only way to become  beautiful once for all.
