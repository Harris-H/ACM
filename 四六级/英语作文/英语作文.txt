                                          How to Wipe out Drunk Driving?
        At present,lots of traffic accidents are related to drunk driving,and the number of deaths on account
 of drunk driving is increasingly growing,which does harm to the family and has a bad effect on the 
 country and society.
        From my perspective,when one drinks,one's consciousness is very confused. So Firstly for the safety 
 of ourselves and others, people who will drive can avoid drinking. Besides, I consider the government 
 should make some more strict and specific laws to reduce drunk driving. Such as strengthening the 
 punishment of drunk drivers, giving death sentence for those who cause serious accidents and so on.
 Finally, society should make people realize the harm of drunk driving in depth and  always reminds 
 drivers not to drink.
        When drunk driving is completely wiped out, people's life will be more and more beautiful, and society will be more and more harmonious.
